I am Surya Teja Easari, driven by curiosity about how systems work beneath the surface. What began as an interest in technology gradually evolved into a deeper focus on understanding behavior, design choices, and failure points within complex systems. I enjoy learning by doing, experimenting with ideas, and exploring how different components interact rather than relying only on theory.

Outside of formal work or academics, I spend time building projects, testing setups, and refining systems until they feel stable and purposeful. I value clarity, continuous improvement, and practical thinking. This site serves as a space to document my journey, share what I am learning, and keep track of the things I am building along the way.
